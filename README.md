# Pig Weight Calculator

This application calculates the weight of a pig using the circumference of its heart's girth(just behind the forelegs) and its length from the base of the ear to base of the tail.

Its purpose is to mainly aid rural farmers without access to scales to have a fair idea of the weight of pigs they are own.

It will further assist them in making better bargains when selling their pigs.

Because of the application's target market, it is very light-weight.
